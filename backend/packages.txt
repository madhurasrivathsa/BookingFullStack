with in RoomBooking create serializer.py (we create a serializer because we need to converts django model data to json format)
we use HyperlinkedModelSerializer because we get hyperlink insted of primary key when we are referrring to a single product detail
after our serializer class is ready we need to integrate this in to our views 
with in views.py use generics from rest_framework   (Generics reduce boilerplate code by providing ready-to-use views for typical tasks like creating, reading, updating, and deleting objects.)
CreateAPIView: Handles POST requests for creating objects.
RetrieveAPIView: Handles GET requests for retrieving a single object.
ListAPIView: Handles GET requests for listing multiple objects.
UpdateAPIView: Handles PUT and PATCH requests for updating objects.
DestroyAPIView: Handles DELETE requests for deleting objects.
GenericAPIView: A base class to customize your views further.
